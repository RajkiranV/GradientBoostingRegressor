    "The second family member of Ensemble methods, Boosting plays a crucial role in classification and regression model, as well as in deep learning, which we look a bit further in future videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "In boosting, base estimators are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. The motivation is to combine several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble.\n",

    "## <span style = \"color:red\"> What is gradient? </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the concept taken from Physics. An increase or decrease in the magnitude of a property (e.g. temperature, pressure, or concentration) observed in passing from one point or moment to another. Look at the image below.\n",

    "Gradient Tree Boosting or Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. GBRT is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems. Gradient Tree Boosting models are used in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology."
